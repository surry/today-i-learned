# Single-Index APIs
CRUD APIs in Elasticsearch such as [Index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-index_.html)/[Get](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-get.html)/[Delete](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-delete.html)/[Update](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-update.html) are "single-index" APIs which means that they only work with a single index. However, they will also work with an [alias](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-aliases.html) that points to a single index. But you need to be careful when using these APIs with an alias as they will report an error when the alias points to more than one index.

This makes sense because Elasticsearch requires the index name when updating/reading a document. With an alias that points to multiple indices, Elasticsearch would not know which index to find the document in.
